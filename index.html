            <p>
                My name is Scott Anderson, and I'm the web designer you didn't even know you need! I am a Twin Cities
                based
                web
                developer with front-end experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React as well as back-end
                technologies
                like
                MySQL and MongoDB.
                <br><br>
                I have a passion to learn and be exposed to new languages and cutting-edge technologies, and I can and
                will
                master them quickly. I also make shoot and edit films in my spare time, and I love the attention to
                detail
                and
                precision required to take a project from inception through to finished product.
                <br><br>
                Please review my portfolio for examples of my previous work. Feel free to contact me with any
                questions! I also do part time work as a clown, so consider me for your next birthday party, bar
                mitzvah, company picnic, or for a private session!
